      'Tensorial integrity is an engineering and architectural concept that describes structures in which rigid and flexible elements work together in perfect balance. This project was conceived to create a design that serves as the ideal example of tensegrity, a unique piece where tension and equilibrium merge into a single, harmonious, and efficient form.',

      'The project unites both graphic and product design, combining aesthetics with functionality to create a cohesive and unique visual and sensory experience.',

      'Every visual element has been carefully considered to communicate the concept clearly and with impact.',

      'At the same time, the product design emphasizes balance, proportion, and materiality, ensuring that the piece is not only visually striking but also structurally sound and user-friendly.',

      'This integration of form and function reinforces the projectâ€™s identity, making it a strong example of thoughtful, holistic design.'
