      '"The F*cking Chair" is a social design project focused on creating a functional tool for street-based sex workers. These women are often recognised by the cheap, uncomfortable plastic chairs left at the roadside where they work.',

      'By redesigning these chairs with dignity, the aim was to uplift not only the object but also the women who use it, the most vulnerable and overlooked members of society.',

      'The result is a reproducible, aesthetically thoughtful and affordable design piece.',

      'To reinforce the impact of "The F*cking Chair," a visual and communication identity was developed that presents the project as both a social statement and a functional design solution.',
    '06.png':
      'Graphic materials were created to convey dignity, empathy and innovation, and a presentation was prepared to reach NGOs, social innovation platforms and design institutions.',

      'Documentary-style visuals, collaboration with activist groups and participation in dissemination spaces helped position the proposal as a tool for awareness and change, strengthening its message and facilitating its potential reproduction and implementation.'
