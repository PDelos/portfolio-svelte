      text: 'Key UX Findings\nInformation Architecture & Navigation:\nThe original site suffered from an overloaded top menu and inconsistent labels, making it difficult for users to locate key actions like Reservations or Shop.\nVisual Design:\nOutdated layouts and low-quality imagery failed to communicate the premium cafe experience. Spacing, color balance, and typography lacked harmony and refinement.\nFunctionality & Accessibility:\nThe booking and shop systems were unintuitive and poorly optimized for mobile. The lack of SEO tags and accessible structure also affected discoverability and inclusivity.'

    {

      text: "My Approach & Solutions\nInformation Architecture Redesign:\nI restructured the navigation into seven clear categories: Home, About, Menu, Shop, Reservations, Events, Contact. Prioritizing intuitive flow and quick access to CTAs.\nUX/UI Enhancements:\nI introduced a sticky navigation and prominent primary CTAs. Each key section (Hero, Shop, Events, Subscriptions) was designed to reduce cognitive load and guide users through a fluid browsing journey.\nVisual Language:\nThe new design embraces muted tones, refined serif typography, and cinematic photography to express the brand's European cafe luxury. Micro-animations and scroll cues subtly enhance interactivity without compromising elegance.\nContent Strategy:\nI reframed messaging to highlight the cafe's European roots and artisanal craftsmanship. Hero copy and storytelling elements now evoke sophistication and emotional resonance.\nPerformance & Accessibility:\nThe redesign incorporated image optimization and SEO metadata to ensure the site performs beautifully across all devices and search platforms."
